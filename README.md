## Setup steps: 

#### Install
```bash
 npm i
```
#### Run all tests
```bash
 npm run tests
```
#### Run the third part only
```bash
 npm run test:getintouch
```
#### Run the fourth part only 
```bash
 npm run test:austin
```

#### Third part - Austin test

This test checks that the December lab page loads correctly by validating the title and the main menu. Then we go to the Austin office page and validate the title, the URL, and if the calendar popup is shown by clicking the schedule free consultation button. 

#### Fourth part - Get in touch popup

This test checks that the popup is shown by clicking the get in touch button, and if we click the send button without filling in the required fields, these have a red border. Then, if we fill the fields, they won't have a red border.
